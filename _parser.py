# A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds
# a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other
# hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input, checking for
# correct syntax in the process. […] The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical
# analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters
